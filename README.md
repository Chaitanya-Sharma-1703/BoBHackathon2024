# Problem Statement
Banks are constantly seeking ways to enhance their risk management frameworks, especially in the face of evolving market conditions and regulatory requirements. This project directly addresses a critical need in the industry, offering practical solutions that can be implemented to achieve tangible improvements in risk management processes.
In summary, we decided to solve this problem statement because it offers a unique opportunity to apply advanced AI techniques to a critical and impactful area of banking, aligns with our personal interests, and presents a feasible challenge within the hackathon context.

# Main goals of AI-Insight:
* Enhance Risk Management Capabilities: Develop an advanced LLM agent to predict, assess, and mitigate various types of financial risks.
* Real-Time Anomaly Detection: Implement real-time analysis of large datasets to identify potential risks and anomalies promptly.
* Predictive Insights: Provide accurate predictive insights for market, credit, and operational risks using machine learning models.
* Actionable Risk Mitigation Strategies: Generate and present actionable strategies for risk mitigation, ensuring they are compliant with regulatory standards.
* Regulatory Compliance: Integrate RBI regulatory compliance documents into the system to ensure all risk management activities adhere to legal and regulatory requirements.
* User-Friendly Interaction: Enable a conversational interface through an LLM agent for easy interaction and query handling by users.

# Our Solution:
Our solution leverages an advanced LLM agent to enhance the bank's risk management capabilities by providing real-time analysis, predictive insights, and compliance assurance. The agent interacts conversationally with users to simplify complex tasks, breaking down queries into sub-questions and utilizing integrated tools for anomaly detection, credit risk analysis, market risk, and operational risk. By employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the agent ensures all risk mitigation strategies adhere to RBI regulatory requirements. Hosted on scalable Azure services, our solution offers a user-friendly, adaptive, and robust approach to managing financial risks effectively.

# What are LLM Agents:
So, picture these AI assistants, right? They're basically powered by these massive language models - think of them as super-smart brains that can understand and spit out human language like it's nothing. But here's the cool part: they're not just fancy chatbots. These agents come with some extra bells and whistles, like memory to remember stuff you've said before, planning skills to tackle complex problems, and the ability to tap into other tools and data sources.
It's like giving that smart brain a bunch of superpowers. Now these AI agents can handle all sorts of tricky tasks that need multiple steps, and they don't forget what you're talking about halfway through a conversation. People are using them for all kinds of stuff - from customer service (bye-bye hold music!) to automating boring tasks, and even helping with creative projects. And the best part? You can customize them to be experts in specific fields or jack-of-all-trades helpers.

# What are RAGs?
You know how sometimes you wish your AI assistant had the latest info? That's where RAGs come in. It's like giving your AI a smart research assistant. When you ask a question, the AI doesn't just rely on what it already knows. Instead, it quickly searches through a bunch of up-to-date info, grabs the most relevant bits, and uses that to craft its answer. It's kind of like if you had a super-fast librarian helping you out every time you asked something. This way, the AI can give you more accurate and current answers, instead of just making stuff up or using outdated info. Pretty cool, right?

# How we are leveraging RAGs to come up with risk mitigation strategies while staying withn RBI regulatory compliances?
The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enhance its mitigation strategies by integrating RBI regulatory compliances. It first retrieves relevant regulatory documents and guidelines from a pre-indexed database using a search component. Then, it uses an LLM to generate risk mitigation strategies that adhere to these regulatory requirements. This ensures that all suggested actions are compliant with RBI standards, providing a robust and legally sound risk management solution.
